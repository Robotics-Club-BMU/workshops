<h1>Closing Ceremony</h1>
<h3>Can’t believe…. Our RWOC flagship event has come to an end.
And we successfully completed all our tasks..This was possible only because of your tremendous efforts.
Since today is the last day, we scheduled a closing ceremony at 6pm. 
 Firstly, there would be a token of appreciation for all the mentors, project admins and participants who contributed for RWOC.
Secondly, some videos of our previous events will be shown. And finally, the most important thing, we are organizing a fun game.
@2021 batch... We know your exams are approaching... Don't worry. We don't take much of your time. Let us have fun together. 
See you all at 6 pm.
</h3>
