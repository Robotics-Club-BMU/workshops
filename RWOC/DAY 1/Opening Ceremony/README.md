<li>Opening ceremony â€“ 17th October, 3pm 

<h1>Agenda of Day 1</h1>
<h3>Today is the first day of our event. So, we will not directly jump into the main stuff. There will be a brief description of what kind of projects you will do and the process that you are going to follow. It is just like an overview on what you will be doing the whole week. Come and join us for the opening ceremony at 3pm sharp. Join the opening ceremony and begin your journey for RWOC week. </h3>
